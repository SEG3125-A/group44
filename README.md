### 6. How to run the app:

#### 1. At the root of this directory, install the dependencies specified in the package.json file:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. To run the app on development:

```bash
npm start
```

#### 3. To run the app on production (if we want optimal performance):

Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

Install a Node.js package called "serve" using npm **_(one-time setting)_**:
```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Then serve it with a static server:
```bash
serve -s build
```
